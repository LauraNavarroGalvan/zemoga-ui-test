# Why I used Angular

I have decided to use Angular because:
- It uses TypeScript as its principal programming language, which greatly facilitates development.
- It has a defined squeleton compared to React or another frameworks.
- Its design adopts the standard of web components, allowing the creation of new custom, reusable, and self-contained HTML tags.
- Provides good tool support.
- Excellent documentation and comunity.


# Project structure

## Components: 

contains the pages or sections of the app ( home, how-works, trial, and votes).

## Core: 

this folder contains all the components that are used once over the app, represents the implementation of the cross-cutting concerns of the application, such as header, footer, authentication, and HTTP-interceptors.

## Shared: 

Contain the code that could potentially be reused across the app such as pipes, directives, modules, and models.
